# ion_implantaion
When applied to metals, ion implantation can be used for a variety of purposes, including improving surface properties like hardness, wear resistance, corrosion resistance, and even altering the material's conductivity.

Surface Damage: High-energy ion implantation can cause some damage to the metal's crystal lattice structure, which may affect its mechanical properties. However, this can often be mitigated by post-implantation annealing to repair the damage.
Depth Distribution: Achieving a uniform depth profile of implanted ions can be challenging, particularly if very specific and controlled modification of the surface is required.
