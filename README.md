Computational Project Proposal: Understanding the Effects of Ion Implantation on the Properties of Alloys Using Generalized Representative Structures (GRS)

Project Objective:

The goal of this computational project is to develop a comprehensive simulation framework to study the effects of ion implantation on the atomic and mechanical properties of metal alloys. Using Generalized Representative Structures (GRS), we aim to model the atomic-scale behavior of alloys subjected to ion implantation and predict how changes in composition, crystal structure, and microstructure impact key material properties such as hardness, corrosion resistance, and wear behavior.
